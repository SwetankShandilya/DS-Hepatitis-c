# DS-Hepatitis-c
This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and model selection to predict the category of Hepatitis-C patients. The goal is to thoroughly analyze the provided dataset using various visualization and statistical techniques, and to build predictive models that achieve the best performance.

# Project Overview
This project is divided into several key steps:

• Data Understanding and Preprocessing:

Comprehensive analysis of the dataset using visual and statistical methods.
Utilized pandas and numpy libraries for data manipulation and cleaning.

• Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Detailed examination of data distribution and relationships using visualizations.
Applied matplotlib and seaborn libraries for creating insightful plots.

• Feature Engineering:

Created new features to improve model performance.
Applied techniques such as normalization and encoding categorical variables.

• Model Selection and Evaluation:

Built multiple machine learning models to predict patient categories.
Used scikit-learn library for model implementation and evaluation.
Compared models based on performance metrics to select the best one.

# Libraries Used

• pandas

• numpy

• scikit-learn

• matplotlib

• seaborn

# Key Highlights

• Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, outliers, and performed necessary transformations to prepare the data for analysis.

• Feature Engineering: Generated meaningful features that enhanced the predictive power of the models.

• Model Comparison: Evaluated various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting to identify the most accurate model.

• Visualization: Created comprehensive visualizations to understand the data and interpret the model results effectively.
